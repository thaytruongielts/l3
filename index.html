            const part1Script = `1. Woman: Hello, I‚Äôd like to confirm the departure time for flight BA255 to Paris, please. Man: Let me check. BA255... Ah, yes. It was scheduled for 16:30, but there's a delay. It's now expected to leave at quarter past three. Woman: Quarter past three? So 15:15, then? Man: No, 15:45, madam. That‚Äôs an hour and fifteen minutes later than planned. 
            
            2. Man: We had such an amazing holiday! Woman: I remember you said you were going mountain climbing. Was that the best part? Man: The hike was great, but the long, bumpy train journey through the valley was definitely an experience I won't forget. Much better than the short boat trip we took on the lake, which was too crowded. 
            
            3. Man: Did you find your car keys? I thought you put them in your handbag this morning. Woman: I thought so too, but they aren't there. And I already checked the kitchen counter where I usually leave them. Wait a moment... Yes! They must have fallen out when I sat down. They were right here, under the magazine next to the sofa. 
            
            4. Boy: Mom, I really need something to carry my books for school. This old backpack has holes in it. Woman: Well, we can stop at the sports shop later. I need a new running jacket, but we can look for your bag first. Boy: Actually, could we look at those cool new sports shoes they advertised? My old ones are worn out. Woman: Hmm, okay. Let's start with the shoes, then. 
            
            5. Man (Weather reporter): Good evening. After a lovely, sunny day today, expect conditions to change drastically. Tomorrow, we‚Äôll see strong winds arriving early, bringing heavy rain, especially by midday. Temperatures will remain mild, so no chance of snow yet. 
            
            6. Woman: Shall we meet up to see the new action movie? Man: Great idea! How about meeting inside the cafe first? It's right next to the cinema entrance on King Street. Woman: Actually, that cafe is always packed. Let's just meet at the entrance. It's easier to find each other there than trying to find a table. Man: Sounds good. See you at the entrance then. 
            
            7. Woman: So, what did you decide to do at the summer camp today? Boy: Well, I wanted to join the tennis group, but it was full. They offered me cycling instead. Woman: And? Boy: I decided not to do the cycling in the end. It looks like the pool is free, so I think I‚Äôll go swimming now.`;

            // Formatted for multi-speaker TTS
            const part2Script = `Interviewer: Welcome back to the show. Today we're joined by Sarah Jenkins, the author of the best-selling fantasy novel, The Cloud Weaver. Sarah, what first inspired you to start writing? Sarah: Well, I‚Äôve always been a big reader, especially of historical novels, but I actually started writing quite late. I used to keep a journal of all the weird and wonderful dreams I had. One of my high school teachers read a few entries and convinced me that I had a unique voice and that I should develop those stories. That was the push I needed. Interviewer: And where do you actually do the writing? Do you need a special environment? Sarah: I used to think I needed a silent study with the perfect view, but that‚Äôs impossible these days! I‚Äôve learned to adapt. I can actually block out noise pretty easily. Sometimes, I find the small background buzz of a busy city cafe quite helpful, but mostly I just write at my kitchen table. It doesn't really matter where, as long as I have my laptop. Interviewer: When you start a book, do you plan every chapter meticulously? Sarah: I know many writers plot everything out in advance, like drawing a map. I tried that once, but I found it restricted the story. My process is much more organic. I decide on the beginning and the end, and then I just let my characters start talking. They always take me in directions I never expected. It makes the writing exciting. Interviewer: For young people hoping to follow in your footsteps, what do you see as the biggest hurdle? Sarah: Hmm, it‚Äôs not the writing itself, that‚Äôs the fun part. And honestly, getting published is hard, but if your work is good, it will happen eventually. I think the real struggle, especially when you‚Äôre young, is maintaining the habit. Life is so busy, and it's easy to stop writing for weeks. You must be disciplined to find the time, even if it‚Äôs just 30 minutes a day. Interviewer: And finally, what's next? You‚Äôve finished a huge series. How do you feel about starting the next one? Sarah: I‚Äôve got a completely fresh idea‚Äîa thriller this time, no fantasy! I‚Äôm actually really excited about tackling a different genre. I know there's pressure because the first book was so successful, but I'm trying not to worry about that. I'm focusing on the thrill of the blank page.`;

            <div class="space-y-4 text-sm md:text-base p-4 bg-green-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-[#166534]">
                <p><span class="speaker-name">Interviewer:</span> Welcome back to the show. Today we're joined by Sarah Jenkins, the author of the best-selling fantasy novel, The Cloud Weaver. Sarah, what first inspired you to start writing?</p>
                
                <p><span class="speaker-name">Sarah:</span> Well, I‚Äôve always been a big reader, especially of historical novels, but I actually started writing quite late. I used to keep a journal of all the weird and wonderful dreams I had. One of my high school teachers read a few entries and convinced me that I had a unique voice and that I should develop those stories. That was the push I needed.</p>
                
                <p><span class="speaker-name">Interviewer:</span> And where do you actually do the writing? Do you need a special environment?</p>
                
                <p><span class="speaker-name">Sarah:</span> I used to think I needed a silent study with the perfect view, but that‚Äôs impossible these days! I‚Äôve learned to adapt. I can actually block out noise pretty easily. Sometimes, I find the small background buzz of a busy city cafe quite helpful, but mostly I just write at my kitchen table. It doesn't really matter where, as long as I have my laptop.</p>
                
                <p><span class="speaker-name">Interviewer:</span> When you start a book, do you plan every chapter meticulously?</p>
                
                <p><span class="speaker-name">Sarah:</span> I know many writers plot everything out in advance, like drawing a map. I tried that once, but I found it restricted the story. My process is much more organic. I decide on the beginning and the end, and then I just let my characters start talking. They always take me in directions I never expected. It makes the writing exciting.</p>
                
                <p><span class="speaker-name">Interviewer:</span> For young people hoping to follow in your footsteps, what do you see as the biggest hurdle?</p>
                
                <p><span class="speaker-name">Sarah:</span> Hmm, it‚Äôs not the writing itself, that‚Äôs the fun part. And honestly, getting published is hard, but if your work is good, it will happen eventually. I think the real struggle, especially when you‚Äôre young, is maintaining the habit. Life is so busy, and it's easy to stop writing for weeks. You must be disciplined to find the time, even if it‚Äôs just 30 minutes a day.</p>
                
                <p><span class="speaker-name">Interviewer:</span> And finally, what's next? You‚Äôve finished a huge series. How do you feel about starting the next one?</p>
                
                <p><span class="speaker-name">Sarah:</span> I‚Äôve got a completely fresh idea‚Äîa thriller this time, no fantasy! I‚Äôm actually really excited about tackling a different genre. I know there's pressure because the first book was so successful, but I'm trying not to worry about that. I'm focusing on the thrill of the blank page.</p>
